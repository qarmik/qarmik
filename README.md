## Hi there 👋

My name is Rohit Kumar (Qarmik - Q as in Qarmik).

## What I build

I build **investigator-led risk and accountability tooling** for fintech and financial-crime teams.

My work is **post-incident and evidence-first**:
- deterministic artifacts over dashboards
- explicit refusals instead of silent gaps
- tooling designed to survive audit and regulatory scrutiny

This is hands-on execution, not policy commentary.

---

## Current focus

- Financial crime tooling (EDD, mule networks, audit artifacts)
- Post-incident accountability workflows
- Python-first, low-LOC, regulator-legible outputs

Where possible, tools are designed to mirror how experienced investigators actually reason — not how systems claim they do.

---

## What this is not

- Not employer-affiliated
- Not a product or service
- Not pre-deployment risk scoring
- Not predictive or behavioral surveillance

All work here is **independent** and intended for technical and regulatory examination.

---

## How to read this GitHub

- Repositories show **finished artifacts**, not demos
- Documentation states **limits explicitly**
- If something cannot be done, that is recorded — not hidden

If you are reviewing this as a fintech, audit, or risk leader:
this repository is meant to be read, challenged, and replayed.
